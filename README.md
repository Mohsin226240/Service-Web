This is my personal services website where I’ve highlighted the main web development services I offer.

I’ve built the entire site using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. The design is fully responsive, so it works well on all screen sizes including mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

The website layout includes a clean hero section, a detailed services section, and a contact call-to-action. I’ve also added animations, hover effects, and modern styling like glassmorphism to make it more attractive.

CSS3

Bootstrap

JavaScript
